  - name: query_comments
    description: >
      This macro must be used in conjunction with the query_comment feature
      of dbt.
      cf. https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/project-configs/query-comment

      The following snippet must be present in dbt_project.yml:

      ```
      query-comment:
        comment: "{{ query_comment(node) }}"
        append: true
      ```

      The append parameter is best set to `true` as some databases such as
      Snowflake strips out the first comment from history logs for security
      reasons. This parameter ensures the query comment is appended at the
      bottom of the SQL query.
    docs:
      show: false
    arguments:
      - name: node
        type: string
        description: >
          The argument _must_ be the `node` context.
